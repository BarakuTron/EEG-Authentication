# EEG-Authentication
Application providing authentication based on EEG signals collected from a commercial EEG sensor (Neurosky Mindwave Mobile 2). <br>
The application utilizes Auto-WEKA to find and train the optimal classifier for each user.

The project was developed using SpringBoot and React as part of my Final Year Project.

An accuracy of 85.4% was achieved when testing the developed system with 15 adult participants. The participants were asked to wear the EEG headset and complete the registration process (6 minutes) and then perform the authentication process (1 minute).
